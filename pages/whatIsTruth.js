        <br/><br/>
        <p>We all know what truth is: that which describes reality accurately.</p>
        <p>If someone says that there is no truth, he is claiming that he knows &#39;the truth about truth&#39;. If he &#39;knows&#39; that truth is false, he has only disproved himself, for he has shown something to be true. The fact that you can understand anything at all the proof you need that truth exists and that we can recognise true things. If we could understand nothing, discussion would be entirely useless, and it is obvious to me that you should not waste your time listening to anyone who believes that he understands nothing and that nothing can really be understood by others. You are speaking to man trying to argue you both into insanity.</p>
        <p>Therefore, do not be afraid to pursue the truth, but you must keep in mind that there are many people who hate it. The very reason I felt the need to point out the fact that truth exists is because so many deny it, and we must start somewhere.</p>
        <p>Now that we have established that truth exists, more serious topics await.</p>
