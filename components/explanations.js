            <p>(1) Whatever begins to exist has a cause;</p>
            <p>(2) The Universe began to exist;</p>
            <p>(3) Therefore, the Universe has a cause.</p>
            <p>The above is a powerful argument, but modern people often still believe they have found a ways of escaping it. You should believe Universe had a beginning if you’re on this page, but you do not believe in God. That probably means (unless you have convinced yourself of one of the other kooky pseudoscientific explanations) that you believe the Universe came from nothing somehow.</p>
            <p>Can something come from nothing?</p>
            <p>The answer can be determined entirely by logic, and it is no. We can reasonably suppose that one thing could be endowed with the power to create another thing. However, nothing has no power whatever. It is not that it has very little power; it has none. What can arise when there is no force to make it and no power to give it?</p>
            <p>Perhaps you believe that chance is the answer, but an example should clear this up: if you have no connection to any betting agency and have placed no bets on horses, what chance do you have of winning millions of dollars on horse racing today anyway? None. Likewise, chance could not have made the Universe pop into existence from nothing. There was no opportunity for it. Chance only describes the likelihood of one thing causing another; it is not a cause itself.</p>
           <p>Now, since there are things in existence rather than no things, something has always existed. There could never have been nothing, or nothing would exist. Note that this reasoning does not only apply to our universe, but to any number of universes and supernatural entities. Something must have never begun to exist yet exists.</p>
            <p>Since this being has always existed, it must be able to exist outside of time—but when things subject to time were created, time began. This time could aptly be called The Beginning. Further, it must have chosen to act, since if it did not have a rational nature, this being could not have created something so consistent and logical and brilliant as the universe; nor would there be any reason that our universe is sustained in existence and does collide with countless other universes at every moment. Indeed, the conclusion is that there is a God.</p>

            <p>The Universe is subject to time&ndash;it changes with time. However, there cannot have been an infinite amount of time in the past, as that does not make sense. If there were infinite weeks before this week, we would never have reached the current week. Therefore, the Universe has not always existed.</p>
            <p>The appropriate follow-up question is: how can time and the Universe have begun then? Both exist now, clearly, but they cannot have always existed.</p>
            <p>First, whatever created the Universe must be outside of what we think of as nature. Second, whatever created time is timeless. Third, this entity must be intelligent for many reaons.</p>
